1)Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler:-

->With the Capacity Scheduler a separate dedicated queue allows the small job to start as soon as it is submitted 
whereas the FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of submission.
->In Capacity Scheduler it takes the cost of overall cluster utilization since the queue capacity is reserved for jobs in that queue
whereas in FIFO Scheduler requests for the first application in the queue are allocated first and then the next application in the queue is served and so on.
->In Capacity Scheduler if queues are not designed or used properly some queues may be overloaded while some may be underutilised.
whereas the FIFO Scheduler is not suitable for shared clusters.
->Large applications will use all the resources in a cluster and so each application has to wait its turn.
 So on a shared cluster it is better to use the Capacity Scheduler or the Fair Scheduler but large job finishes late when compared with using the FIFO Scheduler. 

2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x?

->Hadoop 1.x is not suitable for real-time data processing whereas hadoop 2.x supports real-time processing of data.
->Hadoop 1.x is not suitable for data streaming whereas hadoop 2.x enables streaming of data.
->Hadoop 1.x supports only 4000 nodes per cluster whereas hadoop 2.x supports more than 10000 nodes per cluster.
->Hadoop 1.x supports one and only one programming model that is the MapReduce whereas 
Hadoop 2.x supports multiple programming models with YARN Component like MapReduce, Interative, Streaming, Graph, Spark, Storm etc.
->Hadoop 1.x does not support Multi-tenancy whereas hadoop 2.x supports Multi-tenancy.
